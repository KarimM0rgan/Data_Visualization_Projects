# Data Visualization Projects

A small collection of dashboard projects I built with **Excel**, **Tableau**, and **Power BI**.
Each project starts with raw data â†’ cleaning/transformations â†’ exploratory views (tables, pivot tables, sheets) â†’ a polished, interactive dashboard.

## ðŸ§ª Process & Methodology

Across all three projects I followed a repeatable workflow:

1. **Data Intake & Cleaning**

   * Standardize categorical values, fix types, trim whitespace, handle missing/outliers
2. **Modeling & Calculations**

   * Pivot transforms (Excel), Calculated Fields (Tableau), DAX measures (Power BI)
3. **Exploratory Visuals**

   * Quick tables and intermediate charts to validate logic
4. **Dashboard Assembly**

   * Layout grids, consistent labeling, legends, and interactive controls
5. **QA & Performance**

   * Crossâ€‘checks between views, filter testing, and formatting polish
